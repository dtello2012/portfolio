# Portfolio site for udacity
The project was created to implement **HTML5**, **CSS3** and _responsive design_ on my portfolio site.

## NOTE:
I used bootstrap 4.0 beta to take advantage of using flexbox for the grid
in conjunction with font awesome 4.7.0 for icons

# To run the project
Download or clone the repository of the project
* open the index.html file

Opening the file will open up a browser and display my portfolio site.
